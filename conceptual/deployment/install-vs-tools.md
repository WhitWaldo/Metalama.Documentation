# Installing Metalama Tools for Visual Studio

Metalama Tools for Visual Studio is an extension to Visual Studio that helps you write and use aspects with Metalama.

You can download it from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PostSharpTechnologies.metalama).

You can use Metalama without installing this extension, but this is highly recommended.

Its principal features include:

* Syntax highlighting of aspect code.
* A tool to show the _diff_ between the source code and the code augmented by the aspects.
* A Code Lens extension to show which aspects affect the source code.


> [!NOTE]
> The version of Metalama Tools for Visual Studio and the version of the Metalama NuGet packages in your project do not need to match. However, if you are using a _pre-release_ version of _both_ Metalama Tools for Visual Studio and the NuGet packages, you may need to keep the version of Metalama Tools for Visual Studio and the NuGet packages synchronized.
