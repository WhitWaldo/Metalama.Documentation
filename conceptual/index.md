Caravela has the following principal features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| __Aspect-Oriented Programming__ | Encapsulate repetitive patterns of code (such as logging, caching, INotifyPropertyChanged, multi-threading) into executable artifacts named _aspects_ that add behaviors to your code at compile time, so that your source code remains clean and succinct &mdash; easier to read and maintain.
| __Code Generation__             | Generate repetitive code, in the editor or at compile time, instead of writing it by hand.
| __Code Validation__             | Verify that hand-written code complies to team rules and conventions.
