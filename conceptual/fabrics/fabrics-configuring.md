# Configuring Aspects using Project Fabrics


Aspect libraries may expose a configuration API to set options that affect all aspect instances. These options may be set in the `AmendProject` method of the project fabric.

To learn how to expose a configuration API for your aspect, see <xref:exposing-configuration>.
