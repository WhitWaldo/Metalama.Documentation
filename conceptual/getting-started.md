# Getting Started with Metalama

1. **Install Metalama**. Add the `Metalama.Framework` package to your project. We also recommend to install [Metalama Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PostSharpTechnologies.metalama).
   
   See <xref:installing> for details.
   
2. **Start removing boilerplate**. Create your first aspect that overrides a method and adds a new feature like logging or retrying. 
   
   See <xref:overriding-methods> for details.

3. **Validate your source code**. Reports errors and warnings to the IDE or to the build when the source code is off the line. 

   See <xref:validation> for details.

4. **Suggesting code fixes**. Suggest code fixes from your warnings, or suggest refactorings. 
   
   See <xref:building-ide-interactions> for details.

5. **Adding aspects in bulk with fabrics**. Instead of adding aspects one by one using custom attributes, do it programmatically. 
   
   See <xref:fabrics-aspects> for details.
