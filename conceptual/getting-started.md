# Getting started with Metalama

1. **Install Metalama**. Add the [Metalama.Framework](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalama.Framework) package to your project. We also recommend that you install [Metalama Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PostSharpTechnologies.metalama).

   See <xref:installing> for details.

2. **Start removing boilerplate**. Create your first aspect that overrides a method and add new features like logging or retrying.

   See <xref:overriding-methods> for details.

3. **Validate your source code**. Report errors and warnings to the IDE or to the build if your source code does not respect coding rules.

   See <xref:validation> for details.

   See <xref:validation> for details.

4. **Add IDE interaction**. Provide code fixes in response to your warnings, or add refactorings.

   See <xref:building-ide-interactions> for details.

5. **Add aspects in bulk with fabrics**. Instead of adding aspects one by one using custom attributes, do it programmatically with fabrics.

   See <xref:fabrics-aspects> for details.
