# Sample aspects for demonstration

For the demonstration purposes of how to use aspects, we shall use the following prebuilt aspects

|Aspect | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
|`Log` | To log calls of a method 
|`Retry` | To retry a method a certain number of times
|`NotifyingPropertyChanged` | To notify types of a property change 

You can download the Nuget package with these aspects at  ![TO_Be_Filled_URL](here)

These aspects, when applied will change the behavior of your source code without modifying it at the source level. These will transform the code before the generated code is given to the compiler. 

> [!NOTE]
> Again, you need not worry about their implementation as of now because in this chapter you shall only consume them.
