# Adding Aspects

There are several ways to add aspects to your methods. You can see details of these in the following chapters 


|Method | Description 
|--------|---------------
|<xref:adding-aspects-custom-attr>| When you know exactly what aspect you want to apply and know their name you can use the name of the custom attribute directly on the method 
|<xref:adding-aspects/adding-aspects-context-menu>| Metalama Visual Studio Plugin helps you to locate applicable aspects on your method and then list them for you to choose. So adding aspects becomes really easy and can be achieved by just clicking a button on the screw driver menu.
