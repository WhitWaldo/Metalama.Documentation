# Metalama Diff 
Aspects transform your code. You can see how this modified code differs from your source code by the Metalama Diff option from the context menu. 

To see this diff version simply right click on the code. This will pull up the menu like this 

![Metalama_Diff_Menu_Option](../images/../using-aspects/images/showing_metalama_diff_option.png)

Once clicked the difference between the source code and the changed code will be displayed side by side like this 

![Metalama_Diff_Side_by_Side](../images/../using-aspects/images/lama_diff_side_by_side.png)

The screenshot shows just the original source of `FlakyMethod` and the modified code by the `[Log]` aspect. However you can see that the command shows the entire file in its original and modified version side by side. 

To see changes for a particular section of the code, select that part of the code from the dropdown as shown below.
