    <!-- This is a list of rules that are applied when an article is requested but cannot be found.
         To match, a rule should fulfil two conditions: the `from` attribute should match the article path, and the new 
         article path specified by the `to` attribute should exist. The first rule that fulfils the two conditions wins. -->
