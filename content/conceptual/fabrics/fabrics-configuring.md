# Configuring aspects using project fabrics


Aspect libraries can provide a configuration API to set options that affect all aspect instances. These options can be set in the `AmendProject` method of the project fabric.

To learn how to expose a configuration API for your aspect, see <xref:exposing-configuration>.
