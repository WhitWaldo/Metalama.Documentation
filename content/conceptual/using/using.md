# Using Metalama

If you want to learn how to _use_ aspects, but do not need to learn how to _create_ new ones, this chapter is for you, and you may stop reading after this one. If you want to learn how to create aspects, it's still a good idea to start with this chapter to become accustomed to the core principles.

After finishing this guide you should be comfortable using aspects in your codebase.

## Who should read this chapter?

Read this chapter if:

* you have  just joined a team that is already using Metalama;
* you are planning to use ready-made aspects but don't plan to build your own;
* you plan to create your own aspects in the future, but don't want to put the cart before the horse.

|Article | Description
|--------|-------------
|<xref:getting-aspects> | This article describes where to get aspects, and lists the sample aspects that will be used for demonstrations across this guide.
|<xref:quickstart-adding-aspects> | This article explains how to use an aspect on a target by adding attribute manually or by using the refactoring menu.
|<xref:understanding-your-code-with-aspects>| This article explains how to use Code Lens and Code Diff to understand your code.
|<xref:debugging-aspect-oriented-code> | This article explains how you can debug this transformed code as you would otherwise do with Visual Studio.
|<xref:applying-live-templates> | Live templates are special kinds of aspects that directly modify your source code in the editor. This article explains how to use them.
|<xref:fabrics-adding-aspects>| Adding aspects by hand or by context menu is not always possible or viable. Sometimes a programmatic way is needed to add aspects to different targets. This article shows how you can use `Fabrics` to add aspects to different targets programmatically.
