# Installing Metalama Tools for Visual Studio

Metalama Tools for Visual Studio are an extension to Visual Studio that helps you write and use aspects with Metalama.

You can download it from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PostSharpTechnologies.metalama).

This extension is optional but is highly recommended.

The main features are:

* Syntax highlighting of aspect code and templates.
* A tool to show the _diff_ between source code and the code augmented with aspects.
* A Code Lens extension to show which aspects affect the source code.


> [!NOTE]
> The version of Metalama Tools for Visual Studio and the one of Metalama NuGet packages in your projects do not need to match. However, if you are using a _pre-release_ version of _both_ Metalama Tools for Visual Studio and NuGet packages, you may need to keep the version of Metalama Tools for Visual Studio and the NuGet packages synchronized.
