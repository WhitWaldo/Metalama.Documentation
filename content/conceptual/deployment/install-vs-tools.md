# Installing Metalama Tools for Visual Studio

Metalama Tools for Visual Studio is an extension to Visual Studio that helps you write and use aspects with Metalama.

You can download it from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PostSharpTechnologies.metalama).

While you can use Metalama without installing this extension, it is highly recommended that you do so.

Its principal features include:

* Syntax highlighting of aspect code.
* A tool to show the _diff_ between the source code and the code transformed by the aspects.
* A Code Lens extension to show which aspects affect the source code.


> [!NOTE]
> Metalama Tools for Visual Studio and Metalama packages do not need to match in version. However, if you are using _pre-release_ versions of both Metalama Tools for Visual Studio and Metalama packages, you may need to ensure they match in versions.
