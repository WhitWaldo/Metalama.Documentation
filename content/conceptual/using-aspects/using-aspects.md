# Using Aspects
 
 This chapter explains how to use aspects in your code. It assumes that you already have some aspect to use -- either you have built it yourself as described in <xref:aspects> (good news: you don't need to know how to _create_  aspects to be able to _use_ them), or you are using an aspect library developed by a colleague, PostSharp Technologies, or a third party.
