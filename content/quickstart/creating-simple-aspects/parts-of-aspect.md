# Parts of aspect 


Aspects are one of the building blocks of Metalama. 

## Building custom aspects
An aspect implementation has two major parts. 

* Building the aspect. 
* Setting eligibility for the aspect.

Building the aspect is done via the `BuildAspect` method. Setting eligibility for the aspect is done by implementing the `BuildEligibility` method.
