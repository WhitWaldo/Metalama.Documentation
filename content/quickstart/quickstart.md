# Quick Start Guide to Metalama

Welcome to the Quick Start Guide for Metalama!

Metalama is a powerful tool that improves your code quality and productivity, as well as that of your entire development team. It is a meta-programming framework, meaning it allows you to program the act of programming itself.

Before we begin, it's important to understand the concept of an _aspect_. An aspect is a reusable unit of meta-programming that can be applied to a method, class, property, or to any other C# declaration. They add features to the source code at compile time, validate the code and its usage and trigger customizations in an IDE by suggesting code refactorings.


Now, let's get started!

This book has the following chapters:

| Chapter | Description |
|--------|----|
| <xref:quickstart-using-metalama> | If you want to learn how to _use_ aspects but do not need to learn how to create new ones, this chapter is for you and you may want to stop reading after this one. |
| <xref:creating-simple-aspects> | This chapter explains how to create your own aspects. |
| TODO | This chapter explains how to validate your code against architecture rules. |
