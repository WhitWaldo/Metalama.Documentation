# Quick Start Guide to Metalama

Welcome to the Quick Start Guide for Metalama!

Metalama is a powerful tool that improves your code quality and productivity, as well as that of your entire development team. It is a meta-programming framework, meaning it allows you to program the act of programming itself.

Before we begin, it's important to understand the concept of an _aspect_. An aspect is a reusable unit of meta-programming that can be applied to a method, class, property, or any declaration. They add features to the source code at compile time, validate the code and its usage, and customize the IDE experience by suggesting code refactorings.

The experience of _using_ existing aspects is very different from _building_ new ones. _Using aspects_ is simple if they were designed and implemented properly and it can be achieved by developers with any level of experience. Creating simple aspects for your own usage is also quite a simple and enjoyable undertaking. However, _creating robust aspects_, which will be used by a large team, requires more experience, high abstraction skills and a strong passion for clean code. 

Now, let's get started!

This book is composed of the following chapters:

| Chapter | Description |
|--------|----|
| <xref:quickstart-using-metalama> | If you want to learn how to _use_ aspects but do not need to learn how to create new ones, this chapter is for you and you may want to stop reading after this one. |
| <xref:creating-simple-aspects> | This chapter explains how to create your own aspects. |
| TODO | This chapter explains how to validate your code against architecture rules. |
