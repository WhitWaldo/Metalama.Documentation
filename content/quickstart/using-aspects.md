# Using Metalama

If you want to learn how to _use_ aspects but do not need to learn how to _create_ new ones, this chapter is for you and you may want to stop reading after this one. If you want to learn how to create aspects, it's still a good idea to start with this chapter to get accustomed with the core principles.

After finishing this guide you should be comfortable using aspects in your codebase. 

## Who should read this chapter?

If you should read this chapter if:

* you have just arrived on a team that already uses Metalama,
* you are planning to use ready-made aspects but don't plan to build your own,
* you want to create your aspects in the future, but don't want to put the cart before the horse.
