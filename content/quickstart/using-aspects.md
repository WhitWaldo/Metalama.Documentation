# Using Metalama

If you want to learn how to _use_ aspects (and don't need to learn how to _create_ them), this chapter is for you; you may want to stop reading after this one. If you want to learn how to _create_ aspects, it's still a good idea to start with this chapter to get acquainted with the core principles.

After you finish this guide, you should be comfortable using aspects in your codebase.

## Who should read this chapter?

If you should read this chapter if:

* you have just joined a team that is already using Metalama,
* you are planning to use ready-made aspects but don't plan to build your own,
* you plan to create your own aspects in the future, but don't want to put the cart before the horse.


## In this chapter

|Article | Description
|--------|-------------
|<xref:install> | Shows steps to install Metalama Visual Studio plugin.
|<xref:getting-aspects> | Shows how to get the sample aspects that will be used for demonstrations in this guide.
|<xref:quickstart-adding-aspects> | Shows steps to use an aspect on a target by adding attribute by hand or using the refactoring menu.
|<xref:understanding-your-code-with-aspects>| Describes how to use features of the Metalama plugin for Visual Studio to better understand your aspect-oriented code.
|<xref:debugging-aspect-oriented-code> | Aspects transform code. This article shows how you can debug this transformed code as you would do otherwise in Visual Studio.
|<xref:adding-aspects-in-bulk>| Adding individual aspects by hand or by context menu is not always possible or viable. Sometimes you need a programmatic way to add aspects to target types. This article shows how you can use `Patterns` to add aspects to different target types programmatically.
